## MEROS FRAMEWORK
> **NOTE:** The Meros framework is intended for use with a Meros starter theme for Wordpress. To get started with a theme, go to the [Meros Blocks repository.](https://github.com/mirror-and-mountain/meros-blocks)

### About
This framework underpins our Meros starter themes for Wordpress. Under the hood it's an extension of the incredible [Acorn](https://roots.io/acorn/) package from the team at [Roots.io](https://roots.io). In turn, Acorn brings the power of [Laravel](https://laravel.com) to Wordpress. Our goal with this framework is to provide a developer-friendly environment for creating Wordpress themes that benefit from a standardised approach for adding features through a Laravel-esque syntax and overall experience.

### License 
The Meros Framework is open-sourced software licensed under the MIT license.
